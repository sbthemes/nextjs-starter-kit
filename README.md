# Next.js starter kit

The "Next.js Starter Kit" is a pre-configured package that provides a basic structure for building a Next.js application. It comes with built-in features such as user authentication, registration, email verification, and password management.

It's designed to help kickstart project with any backend frameworks. I have provided AdonisJS v6 repo which works out of box with this kit. The authentication system is based on access tokens, a common standard used in many backend frameworks. Therefore, you can integrate it with other backend frameworks like Laravel, Express.js, etc., as long as they support token-based authentication.

## Backend frameworks

-   AdonisJS: https://github.com/sbthemes/adonis-api-starter-kit
